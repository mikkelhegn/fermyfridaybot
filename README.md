# Check if it's Friday in the Fermyon Cloud

This is a small Slack bot - most of the code is taken from the [FermyBot3000 repo](https://github.com/lann/fermybot3000).

1. Build the code `spin build`
1. Deploy the app to Fermyon Cloud `spin deploy`
1. Create a Slack App to respond to your desired [Slash Command](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands)

Have fun!
